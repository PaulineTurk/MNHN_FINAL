# Internship at the National Museum of Natural History (MNHN) on amino-acid mutation prediction

Project still under development.

Project developed during my Master 2 internship for the AgroParisTech and ParisSaclay engineering degree.

The objective is to evaluate the prediction of the mutation of an amino acid knowing a more or less large window of neighboring amino acids in a protein sequence.

The dataset used is the multiple sequence alignments called "seed" from the Pfam database (Pfam-A.seed.gz from http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/Pfam/current_release/)

The proof of concept is realized by the calculation of probabilistic substitution matrices with or without a contextual amino acid.

The user guide will be added when the project will be fully completed.
